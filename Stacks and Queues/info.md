# STACKS AND QUEUES

Stack and Queue are two data structures where the processing order is restricted.

They are both linear data structures and are flexible with their sizes.

The difference comes in how elements are removed from them. 

**STACK - LIFO (Last In First Out)**

eg: A stack of dishes. 

**QUEUE - FIFO (First In First Out)**

eg: A queue of people at the ticket counter.
