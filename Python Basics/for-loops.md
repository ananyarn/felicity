# For Loop Syntax

for variable in iterable:
    # Code block (indented)

Examples:
1. Loop through a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

2. Using range()
for i in range(5):  # 0 to 4
    print(i)

3. With start and stop:
for i in range(1, 6):  # 1 to 5
    print(i)

4. With stop:
for i in range(0, 10, 2):  # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
    print(i)
