# ARRAYS

An array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations (memory for each item is allocated sequentially).

**BASIC TERMINOLOGIES**
1. Array Element - Each value in an array.
2. Array Index - Elements in an array are identified by their indexes. (Starts from 0)
3. Array Length - Number of elements in an array. 

**Types of Arrays**
Two classifications - based on size and dimension. 
SIZE: Fixed Sized Arrays and Dynamic Sized Arrays
DIMENSION: 1D Arrays and Multidimensional Arrays (2D (Matrix), 3D, etc.)

**OPERATIONS ON ARRAY**
1. Array Traversal - sequential access of elements
2. Array Element Insertion (at the beginning, at a specific index, at the end) - Here, the elements starting from the particular position of insertion are shifted and the element is inserted. Size is also updated. 
3. Array Element Deletion (from the beginning, from a specific index, from the end) - Here, the element from the particular position of deletion is removed and the elements are shifted forward. The size is then updated. 
4. Searching (Linear, Binary) - Process of finding a specific element.

**Applications of Arrays**
1. Implementing matrices (2D arrays) used in computations like graph algorithms and image processing. 
2. Implementing other data structures like stacks and queues. 
3. Serves as data buffers and queues. 
4. Dynamic programming aklgorithms often use arrays to store intermediate results of subproblems.
