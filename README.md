# ✨ Felicity — DSA Notes

Welcome to **Felicity**, a personal collection of clear and concise notes on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. This repo is my knowledge base for revising concepts, learning patterns, and preparing for coding interviews.

📌 This is not a solution bank — it's focused on **understanding over memorizing**. You'll find:

- 📘 Clean, structured notes
- 🔹 Code snippets only when they help clarify a concept
- 🧠 Patterns, visualizations, and tips
- 🛠️ Practical insights for interviews

## 📝 Note Format

Each note typically includes:
- Concept explanations
- Bullet points for quick recall
- Key algorithms
- Mini code snippets (only if essential)
- Time and space complexity
